# MARKDOWN

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

## What I learned

* How the Markdown format makes styled collaborative editing easy
* How Markdown differs from traditional formatting approaches
* How to use Markdown to format text
* How to leverage GitHub’s automatic Markdown rendering
* How to apply GitHub’s unique Markdown extensions

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

GitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people. If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @kneath — love your sweater!

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item

When you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It works in Pull Requests, too!

And, of course emoji!
